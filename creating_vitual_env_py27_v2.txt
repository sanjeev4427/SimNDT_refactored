python 2.7.0 does not contain pip and distutil error happens. 

Download python2.7.16 with x86-64 installer. 

C:\Python27\python.exe -m pip install virtualenv
C:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe --python=python2.7 envname or add C:\Python27\Scripts\ to the path to recognize pip2 and virtualenv

-create virtual environment
-check for the python version.
-install the requirements from the txt files using normal command pip install -r req.txt
-OpenCL creates problem in installation. Even without OpenCL simulation can be run by selecting cpu from menu and running simulation without interruption. 

Fastest solution by using conda (I installed OpenCL drivers first. I do not know if that helped in easy installation of pyopencl, steps at the end):

1. Hassle free installation of python 2.7 using : conda create -n py27env python=2.7
2. Install pyopencl using conda (no visual c++ required): conda install -c conda-forge pyopencl. 
3. Install all the requirements except pyopencl using pip (faster).
4. Now the GPU will be detected.

Installing OpenCL driver:

1. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK/releases (select penCL-SDK-v2024.10.24-Win-x64.zip)
2. Extract. open a Command Prompt in the folder having clinfo and type: clinfo.exe
